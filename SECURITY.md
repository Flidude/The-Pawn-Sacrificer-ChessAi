Security Policy

The Chess AI project takes security seriously, 
but we like to keep things fun and lighthearted. Here's our security policy:

Reporting a Security Concern:

If you come across a security concern or vulnerability in our Chess AI,
we encourage you to let us know, but please don't yell "Checkmate!" too loudly.
Send us an email at flidude.is.real@gmail.com to report the issue.

Responsible Disclosure:

We kindly request that you be a good sport and give us a chance to address any security concerns before telling the world about them. 
We appreciate your cooperation in keeping the game fair and ensuring everyone has a good time.

Bounty of Pawns:

While we don't have a formal bug bounty program, we believe in rewarding good sportsmanship.
If you responsibly disclose a security vulnerability to us, we'll send you a virtual "Bounty of Pawns" trophy.
It may not have any real value, but it'll look great on your virtual shelf!

Security Updates:

We'll be keeping an eye out for any security concerns and will release updates as needed.
Expect our knights to be on the lookout for any sneaky tactics and our rooks ready to fortify the defenses.

Disclaimer:

While we'll do our best to ensure the security of the Chess AI, we can't guarantee that it's impervious to all tricks and traps.
Just like in a game of chess, unexpected moves can happen. So, let's have fun and enjoy the game together!
